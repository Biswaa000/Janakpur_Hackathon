## *Project Title*

### *Gender Equality, Safety, and Dignity: Anonymous Incident Reporting & Evidence Vault*

----------

## *Short Description*

A secure, anonymous, and empathetic digital platform designed to support individuals facing gender-based violence, harassment, or violations of personal dignity. The system allows users to:

-   Submit incident reports anonymously
    
-   Receive AI-powered guidance
    
-   Securely store evidence
    
-   Connect with trusted NGOs for real-time support
    

Built with a modular and scalable architecture, the platform supports global communities through multi-language capability, culturally adaptive design, encrypted data protection, and AI-driven empathetic interaction. It aims to increase reporting rates, reduce response time, and drive long-term policy and social impact through reliable, anonymized insights.

----------

## *Problem Statement*

Gender-based violence and harassment persist globally, yet many victims avoid formal reporting due to:

-   Fear of retaliation
    
-   Lack of privacy
    
-   Social stigma
    
-   Inaccessible reporting channels
    
-   Lack of timely support
    

Current systems are often slow, impersonal, or unsafe. There is an urgent need for a trusted, confidential, and supportive digital solution that empowers individuals to report safely, access guidance instantly, and connect to verified organizations for help.

This platform addresses these gaps by providing a secure, anonymous environment backed by strong encryption, AI-driven support, and real-time NGO collaboration.
